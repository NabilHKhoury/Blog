# What is this you may ask?
This is a blog that I am going to start. I have decided to start this becuase I want a way to track my progess and look back on what I am accomplished and how much I have changed.
At this moment, I am one week away from finals and I have been applying for many internships for this summe rand throughout the year. Thank God, many companies have liked my resume.
Therefore, they have asked me to do coding interviews. 
This has been rough. I never really focused on coding interviews because I was focused on getting expereinces that would make me useful in an actual job. 
I have done many coding interviews and spanning many hours, but I have not done one interview that I see as a success. Maybe I am too hard on myself since I only started coding less than a year ago,
but I know that I am not prepared for the interview process. Coupled with the fact that I am extremely busy with schoolwork for finals, I have been losing momentum. 
I am not the type of person to worry, but my faith is being tested, that's for sure. On the positive end, going through this difficult week will lead to an internal change in myself.
They say that difficult times are the times that lead to the greatest and most benficial changes. 
We will see, and you will get to find out also.
