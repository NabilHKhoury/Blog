# December Blog
Last November, I posted a blog on the 27th, so I fgured I would post one on the following 27th. Much has occured since then, but I will not reveal it all..
  I have been verbally offered multiple internships for the next quarter, but I have only one offer letter at this point. I am very happy as I will be able to 
  contribute to a company or organization and gain and improve some skills; however, I am also concerned I may make a mistake.
 Time is the most valuable asset that I have. 
 Using time wisely, will yeild to success and many great things, but using time unwisely, leads to failure and many terrible things. 
Inshallah, I will be lead in the correct direction.
